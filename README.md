Data from external sources

For Data Science project, I played around with a dataset about alcohol consumption of students in Portugal

My data science sandbox written by myself as a test of pandas and study how to use dataframes
Data is rather small so results are also rather boring

FizzBuzz sandbox is based on code from a blog but additional changes by me (tSNE plot)

Tensorflow sandboxes also mostly from other sources with small variations and changes from me
