Sandbox repository for ideas and tests
written by Isabel Schwende

Data from external sources
crime in the US data: http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/great-github-list-of-public-data-sets

My data science sandbox written by myself as a test of pandas and study how to use dataframes
Data is rather small so results are also rather boring

FizzBuzz sandbox is based on code from a blog but additional changes by me (tSNE plot)

Tensorflow sandboxes also mostly from other sources with small variations and changes from me
-> Sandbox being used for studying purposes only, all rights go with the authors
